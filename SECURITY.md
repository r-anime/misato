# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The live bot and site running for the /r/anime Discord server is always
supported. If you find a vulnerability in an older version of the bot being run
by someone else, reach out to them first and ask them to update their instance;
feel free to reach out here as well if updating is impractical and a patch for
that specific version is required.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities to <security+ranime@eritbh.me>. Expect a response
within three days. Please do not use Github issues to report security problems,
and please attempt to report a vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We
don't have a hard policy for disclosure/response timeline, but will do our best
to address reported vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
